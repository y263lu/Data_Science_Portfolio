# COVID19 Behaviour Analysis: KNN

Study a data set collected by the Institute of Global Health Innovation Imperial College London. Perform KNN to find the best model.

This dataset includes information about symptoms, testing, isolation, social distancing, and other COVID-19-related behaviors for tens of thousands of individuals across 29 countries. The data come from interviews, with around 21,000 individuals interviewed each week, from the end of March until the data were downloaded in mid-August.

Note: Dataset has already been restricted to Canada and USA only and a much smaller number of variables.
